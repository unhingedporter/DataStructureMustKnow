Dynamic programming :

Optimization over plain recursion:
        
       Recursion
        get base case 
        solve sub problem again and again
            Store solution of the same sub problen
              
    Idea of dp is to reuse the Solution of subproblems
        Memorization (Top down)
        Tabulation (Bottom up)
    
    Application:
        Bellman Ford Algorth (shortest path from sorce to destinatioj)
        Floyd - Shortest distance between vertices of different graph
        Diff Utitlity - Longest common seubsequence
        Search Cloud words (Edit distance)
        Resource Allocatin (0-1 Knapsack)
