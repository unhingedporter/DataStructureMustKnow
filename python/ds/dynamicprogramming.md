Dynamic programming :

<h4> Optimization over plain recursion:
        
   - Recursion
        get base case 
        solve sub problem again and again
            Store solution of the same sub problem
   - Idea of dp is to reuse the Solution of subproblems
        Memorization (Top down)
        Tabulation (Bottom up)
     
   - Application:
        - Bellman Ford Algorithm (shortest path from sorce to destinatioj)
        - Floyd - Shortest distance between vertices of different graph
        - Diff Utitlity - Longest common seubsequence
        - Search Cloud words (Edit distance)
        - Resource Allocatin (0-1 Knapsack)
